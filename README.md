LaTeX template for UiT exams. 
=========================

I got tired of dealing with MS Word based exam templates that didn't work properly. Including source code in the documents was also a problem. 

When the administration started requiring a separate grading guideline, I gave up on the Word solution. Keeping two separate Word documents coherent is not something I want to spend time on. 

I have tried to keep the template as close to the original as possible with a few minor additions:

- I have added the Hugin and Munin logo in the lower right part of the page. This is required in the UiT style guides, and it's there in the word templates, but it doesn't show for some reason. 
- I have used the English version of the logos in the English version of the front pages. 
- A few minor language corrections.
